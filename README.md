# Successfully Developed: 
 A web-based communications application designed to provide responses to inquiries submitted by clients. The system enables a group of agents to efficiently address incoming communications from many customers.
  Messages from customers may be transmitted and received via a simulated API endpoint implemented as a straightforward web form.
  Preserve communications from CSV files in a database.Individual messages are accessible via the agents' portal, where they are able to view and reply to them.
  Host my application locally on my system.
  Methods for surfacing messages that require immediate attention and are more essential were investigated.
  Search functionality has been implemented to enable agents to conduct searches on incoming messages and/or customers.
# Notable Accomplishments:
  Messages are sorted by key word matching, with high priority assigned to those that match, and normal priority assigned to the remaining messages.
